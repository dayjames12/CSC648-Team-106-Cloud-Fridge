# CSC648 Team 106 | Cloud Fridge

This application aims to make keeping track of what is in your fridge easy.
Just upload a picture of your receipt and you are ready to go!

The original summary for the project (Not all features were able to be accomplished given the time):  
A user-friendly application to store and keep track of items in your fridge in real-time. The purpose of Cloud Fridge is to save our customers the time of rushing home to check what is in their fridge. 
With Cloud Fridge, it is an easy, quick way to check what food you have at home. An application to save you the trouble of repeatedly getting up to check what items you have in your fridge and keeps track of the nutritional value of your food, all at your fingertips. Our application's suggestive features also tell you what you can make with the items in the fridge so there will never be a need for your food to go to waste.
This app is an inventory management application to make keeping track of your fridge much simpler. Inventory management generally takes time and can be complicated depending on how efficient you want it to be. With Cloud fridge, each item in your fridge has all the essential information such as expiration date, costs, recipe suggestions, and more to take away unnecessary wasted time that the user might spend to look them up individually. 
We are a group of students who are tired of getting up to check our fridge only to remember that we forgot to restock. No more will our time be wasted any longer and met with hopelessness. Our group ranges from juniors and seniors to graduate students with a variety of coding background and experience. To prevent such tragedy from happening to other people like us, we are making a change one fridge at a time.
