A risk was some team members doesn't have much experience using Git/GitHub. This risk is important because all team members should be able to push/pull/commit for their individual role. Our solution was to spend time together to make sure everybody is set up and was able to know which command used for Git and they are able to push into our Github repo.</div>

The risk are some of our group members weren't strong at a particular technical skill set. Our solution was to allow members to work in a particular role that they are interested in and give members who are not as proficient to join a front-end or back-end so the each member can teach each other.</div>

One of our main component for our group project was to have the receipt scanner to our app and the risk was that we never thought to place the receipt scanner to our app. We resolved this problem by correcting our project and to add our receipt scanner.</div>

                    <div class="content">Met in class to discuss Project. Our group decided to start a different Framework called Laravel. This is a risk because our team members needs to relearn a new Framework and need to worry if we could turn our project on time. Laravel was not familiar with everybody in our group and we had difficulties with getting everything installed into our Machine. Those members of our team who had Mac books had some difficulties. Those members who have Macbook that figure out the solution about Laravel helped those students who are struggling with MacBook.</div>

Some members need to install composer and Laravel to start running this Framework. This risk is important because the due date is coming soon and not all students have gotten the Framework into their computer yet. We resolve this problem by providing online resources on our online group chat called Discord so all members can get help when they are away.</div>

                    <div class="content">During our In-class and after-Class meeting, we all spent time working on our group project together. The risk that we have was we are missing our group leader and there are some important information that we need to tell him that our professor had told us. This is a risk because our group hopes to have everybody to get the right message heard and understand what needed to be done for this project. We resolve this issue by our group members who was present reach out to our leader to let him know what was discussed by the professor.</div>

The risk are some members aren't present to work on the project together and wasn't able to communicated the full message to them. We resort to communicated to the students who didn't show up through Discord (Messaging Application). Project milestone 3 is due next week and the risk was don't know if everybody who didn't show up got the message on if members got their parts accomplished.</div>

                    <div class="content">Everybody gathered in class time to fix our project database. The risk was that not everybody had their Database fixed into their machine. Most of our team members had difficulties with using an open-source web-server for databases called XAMPP. This risk is important because We need the database to store our information. We are currently resolving this issue by supporting team members who got XAMPP working and by going online to search solutions to help us. We had a member on our team that was able to get their database of XAMPP and tried his best to help those team members who was struggling.</div>

                    <div class="content">Group came to class together on explaining our group progress so far. There are many improvements that our group should work on. Some of the improvements that our team should think about is deciding which features should go on the nav bar, keep top nav bar for account related things, and adding unique features that is related to the type of food in the Fridge and we should do this by finding API to get this Information. There was also some UX that we should fix in our application as well. These Information that we received from our meeting today from our professor is important because we hope to use this to continue to improve our project. We hope to fix our project ASAP.</div>

                      After class, our team worked on the project and talked about how to  improve on our database of our project and describe what we all have implemented. Some of our team members aren't finished with everything on their part yet but that is ok. Whenever we had time after class, we put effort to make our app better. A risk that our team member are facing was we needed to get the receipt scanning working and to spent time to work on the recommendations we received from the
                      professor last week and each of our team members are contributing by working on parts that we were critiqued on.

                    Met during class to discuss on items needed to work on. A risk that some of our group members are facing are 3 group members have macbooks and are having trouble with accessing the database. However, all members of our team who uses Window computers was able to get access and make changes to the database. The students who have Macbook are able to resolve this problem through accessing their home window computer at home to help make edits to the project. Although some of our group members aren't able to work on the problem, we are able to discuss what needed to be done and once we get home, we can make changes immediately.
